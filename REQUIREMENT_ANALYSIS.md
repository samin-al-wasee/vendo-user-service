# User Service Scope and Requirements Report

## 1. Overview

The User Service is a core component of the Vendo platform, responsible for managing user-related functionalities, including user registration, authentication, profile management, and authorization. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the User Service, establishing a clear understanding of its scope and purpose.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. User Registration
- **Description:** Users should be able to create an account by providing basic information.
- **Required Fields:**
  - Username (unique)
  - Email (unique)
  - Password (encrypted)
- **Optional Fields:**
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Phone Number
  - Address
- **Constraints:**
  - Email validation must be performed.
  - Password must meet complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, use of special characters).
- **API Endpoint:**
  - `POST /api/v1/users/register`

### 2.2. User Login
- **Description:** Registered users should be able to log in using their credentials.
- **Required Fields:**
  - Email or Username
  - Password
- **Response:**
  - JWT Token for authentication
  - OAuth Access Token (if applicable)
  - User profile information
- **API Endpoint:**
  - `POST /api/v1/users/login`

### 2.3. Profile Management
- **Description:** Users should be able to view and update their profile information.
- **Actions:**
  - View Profile
  - Update Profile (e.g., change password, update email)
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/v1/users/profile`
  - `PUT /api/v1/users/profile`

### 2.4. Password Reset
- **Description:** Users should be able to reset their password if they forget it.
- **Process:**
  - Request password reset via email
  - Validate reset token
  - Set new password
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/v1/users/reset-password/request`
  - `POST /api/v1/users/reset-password/confirm`

### 2.5. Roles and Permissions
- **Description:** The system should support role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Roles:**
  - Admin
  - User
  - Vendor
- **Permissions:**
  - Defined based on roles (e.g., Admin can manage users, Vendor can manage their products).
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/v1/roles`
  - `GET /api/v1/roles`
  - `PUT /api/v1/roles/{role_id}`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/roles/{role_id}`

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Security
- **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data, such as passwords, must be encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods (e.g., bcrypt for passwords).
- **Authentication:** Implement JWT-based authentication for API endpoints and OAuth for external integrations and enhanced security.
- **Authorization:** Use role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce permissions.
- **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR for data protection.

### 3.2. Performance
- **Scalability:** The service must be designed to handle a high number of concurrent users, supporting horizontal scaling.
- **Response Time:** API response times should be under 200ms for 95% of requests.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the service.

### 3.3. Reliability
- **Availability:** The User Service must achieve at least 99.9% uptime.
- **Failover:** Implement failover mechanisms to handle server failures without disrupting service.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that user data is consistent and protected from corruption or loss.

### 3.4. Maintainability
- **Code Quality:** Follow coding standards and best practices to ensure the maintainability of the codebase.
- **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for API endpoints and internal logic.
- **Testing:** Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability of the service.

## 4. API Specifications
- **API Versioning:** All endpoints should be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to allow for backward-compatible updates.
- **Request/Response Format:** Use JSON as the standard format for API requests and responses.
- **Error Handling:** Implement consistent error handling with clear error messages and status codes.

## 5. Stakeholder Approval
- **Project Owner:** Approve the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in this document.
- **Development Team:** Review and provide feedback on the feasibility of the proposed requirements.
- **Security Team:** Ensure that the security requirements meet the necessary standards.

## 6. Conclusion

This document provides a detailed scope and requirements analysis for the User Service microservice. It is crucial to review and finalize these requirements before proceeding with the design and development phases to ensure alignment with the overall goals of the Vendo platform.

This report will help guide the development of the User Service by clearly defining what needs to be built and the expectations for its performance, security, and reliability.
